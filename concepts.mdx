# 🧠 Nexra Concepts

Before integrating Nexra, it helps to understand the **key entities and workflows** in our platform.

---

## 🎮 Game

A **Game** is the top-level entity in Nexra. Developers register their game via the Nexra Dashboard to receive a **Game API Key**, which is used for authorization in all API requests.

**Key points:**

- Contains tournaments.
- Managed entirely by the developer via API integration.
- Provides analytics and insights for tournaments and player engagement.

---

## 🏆 Tournament

A **Tournament** is an event where gamers compete. Each tournament can have:

- **Entry fee** (optional, automatically added to the prize pool).
- **Prize pool** (automatically updated as gamers join).
- **Start and end times**.
- **Status**: pending → published → completed.

**Workflow:**

1. Developer creates a tournament via `POST /tournament/create`.
2. Tournament stays pending until published.
3. Once published, gamers can join through the game integration.
4. Nexra automatically manages the prize pool and payouts.

## 👨‍💻 Gamer

A **Gamer** is a participant in a tournament. Gamers join tournaments through the game integrated with Nexra.

**Key points:**

- Gamers pay the entry fee (if applicable).
- Gamers’ participation updates the prize pool automatically.
- Gamers’ progress, ranks, and elimination status are tracked by Nexra.

---

## 👥 Fan

Fans interact with tournaments without directly playing. They can:

- **Predict outcomes** of matches and earn rewards for accuracy.
- **Tip gamers** to support their favorite participants.
- **Fund tournaments** to contribute to the community.

> Note: All rewards, predictions, and tips are automatically managed by Nexra.

---

## 💰 Predictions & Rewards

Nexra handles all **calculations and payouts** automatically.

- Gamers’ entry fees go into the prize pool.
- Accurate predictions earn rewards for fans.
- Winners of tournaments receive their share of the prize pool automatically.
- No manual action required from developers; Nexra ensures payouts are accurate and timely.

---

## 🔄 Statuses

Tournaments have several statuses:

- **Pending** – created but not yet published.
- **Published** – live and accepting gamers.
- **Ongoing** – actively running matches.
- **Completed** – tournament finished, prizes distributed.
- **Eliminated** – gamers removed from the tournament due to elimination rules.

---

## 🔗 Workflow Summary

1. Developer registers game → receives API Key.
2. Developer creates tournament → tournament pending.
3. Developer publishes tournament → gamers join.
4. Gamers compete → Nexra updates ranks and prize pool.
5. Fans predict, tip, or fund tournaments → rewards distributed automatically.
6. Tournament completes → winners receive payouts.
