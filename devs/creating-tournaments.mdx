# 🏆 Creating and Managing Tournaments

This guide explains how developers can create and manage tournaments in their games using Nexra. All prize pools, entry fees, and payouts are handled automatically.

---

## 🔑 Prerequisites

- You must have a **Game API Key** from the Nexra Dashboard.
- Ensure your game is integrated and ready to make API requests.

---

## 🛠 Create a Tournament

Use the `POST /tournament/create` endpoint to create a new tournament.

**Required fields:**

- `game` – ID of your game.
- `name` – Tournament name.
- `description` – Short description.
- `entryFee` – Optional entry fee for players.
- `startTime` / `endTime` – Tournament start and end times.

**Example Request:**

```http
POST /tournament/create
Authorization: ApiKey <your_game_api_key>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "game": "67188e92b41c0eec54f22b1f",
  "name": "Battle of Nexra",
  "description": "An intense tournament for top gamers",
  "entryFee": 50,
  "startTime": "2025-11-10T18:00:00Z",
  "endTime": "2025-11-10T21:00:00Z"
}
```

**Response:**

- `201 Created` – Tournament created successfully, returned with all tournament details.

---

## 📤 Publish a Tournament

A tournament remains **pending** until published. Use `PATCH /tournament/{tournamentId}/publish` to make it live.

**Example Request:**

```http
PATCH /tournament/68fa2b750366dd5ff66d599d/publish
Authorization: ApiKey <your_game_api_key>
```

**Response:**

- `200 OK` – Tournament is now **published** and can accept gamer entries.

---

## ✏️ Update a Tournament

Pending tournaments can be updated before they start using `PATCH /tournament/{tournamentId}/update`.

**Fields you can update:**

- `name`, `description`, `entryFee`, `startTime`, `endTime`

**Example Request:**

```http
PATCH /tournament/68fa2b750366dd5ff66d599d/update
Authorization: ApiKey <your_game_api_key>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "Battle of Nexra - Updated",
  "entryFee": 75
}
```

**Response:**

- `200 OK` – Tournament updated successfully.

---

## 🎯 Summary Workflow

1. **Create a tournament** → it starts in **pending** status.
2. **Update details** if needed before publishing.
3. **Publish** the tournament → gamers can join.
4. **Nexra automatically handles** entry fees, prize pool updates, and payouts.
