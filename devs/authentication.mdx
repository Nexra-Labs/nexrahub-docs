# 🔑 Authentication

All requests to Nexra’s API require authentication to ensure your game and data are secure. Unlike typical bearer tokens, Nexra uses a **Game API Key** that you get when you register your game on the dashboard.

---

## 📝 Get Your Game API Key

1. Go to the [Nexra Dashboard](https://nexra.xyz/dashboard).  
2. Click **Create New Game**.  
3. Fill in your game details (name, description, etc.).  
4. Once the game is created, you will receive your **Game API Key**.

> Keep your API Key secret. Do not share it publicly or embed it in client-side code.

---

## 🔗 Using Your API Key

Include your API Key in the `Authorization` header for all API requests:

```http
Authorization: ApiKey <your_game_api_key>
Content-Type: application/json
```

**Example: Create a Tournament**

```http
POST /tournament/create
Authorization: ApiKey 123456789abcdef
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "game": "67188e92b41c0eec54f22b1f",
  "name": "Battle of Nexra",
  "description": "An intense tournament for top gamers",
  "entryFee": 50,
  "startTime": "2025-11-10T18:00:00Z",
  "endTime": "2025-11-10T21:00:00Z"
}
```

## 🔒 Best Practices

- Never expose your Game API Key in public repositories or frontend code.  
- Rotate your API Key if you believe it has been compromised.  
- Always use HTTPS to secure your API requests.  
- Log and monitor requests from your game for unusual activity.
